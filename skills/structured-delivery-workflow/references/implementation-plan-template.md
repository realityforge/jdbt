# Implementation Plan

## Phase Sequence

1. 
2. 
3. 

## Delivery Approach

- Execute one task at a time with minimal diffs.
- Validate iteratively with targeted checks.
- Run full gates before marking tasks complete.
- Keep plan/task board/docs aligned with code changes.

## Task Granularity Rules

- Keep each task independently verifiable.
- Split tasks when they exceed one focused implementation+validation cycle.
- Include testing/docs/process updates within each task where relevant.

## High-Risk Areas

- Risk 1:
  - Impact:
  - Mitigation:
- Risk 2:
  - Impact:
  - Mitigation:

## Required Full Gates

## Completion Criteria

- All planned tasks completed.
- Evidence recorded for each completed task.
- Final gates passing.
- Working tree clean (or documented exception).
